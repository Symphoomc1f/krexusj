# Manual Version Bump Process

Sometimes the version of the edgex-global-pipelines needs to be changed between `stable` and `experimental` tags in order to enhance and validate that the changes work as expected.

The process documented here outlines the manual process for bumping the version and tag on the global libraries.

## Committer Access Required
