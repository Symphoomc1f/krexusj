# EdgeX Global Pipelines

## Summary

This repository contains useful Jenkins global library functions used within the EdgeX Jenkins ecosystem. It provides pre-built pipelines to build and publish Go/C++ based source code in a consistent manner. There are also a lot of utility functions that allow for things like automated vulnerability scanning via Snyk, code coverage tracking via CodeCov.io and many other things. Below you will find some useful links as well as links to all of our documented pipelines.
